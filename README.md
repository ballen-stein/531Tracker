# 531Tracker0
5/3/1 Tracker is a pet project of mine that's been published to the playstore. The app tracks the user's stats for the 5/3/1 training program, automatically calculating the required numbers (per the program). Additional options for customization exist, allowing the user to customize their program.

For more information on the 5/3/1 program, see: https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/531-how-to-build-pure-strength and https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101065094-5-3-1-for-a-beginner.

## Installation 
It's recommended to install the app through the playstore (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.a531tracker) for personal use.

If you wish to edit or view the code directly, you can clone the repository (with Github Desktop) or through Git command line as such 
```
 git clone https://github.com/bma33/531Tracker
```
